# Bulk Kindle USB Downloader


This is a fork of [bOOkp](https://github.com/sghctoma/bOOkp) with updates to support OTP and changes to Amazon's link structure for downloading ebooks.

This is a quick'n'dirty script to download all your Kindle ebooks.

I needed to backup all my Kindle e-books, so I put together this script. It does
work for now, but a change in the download process will probably break it, and I
may not have the time to fix it right away.

You can download all your e-books (that are eligible for download), or you can
specify multiple ASINs to download. By default the script will only display
warnings, errors, and a finish message. If you want to see progress, you have to
use the `--verbose` flag. Selenium with ChromeDriver is used to handle login,
and you can display the browser with `--showbrowser` - this may come handy if
something goes wrong.

You can also output logging to a file with `--logfile`; this is needed if you have 
enough books to fill your terminal buffer.

The only mandatory command line parameter is the e-mail address associated with
your Amazon account, but of course the script will need your password too - it
will ask for it if not given as parameter. Keep in mind that passwords given as
parameters will probably be stored in you history!

The script will also ask which of your devices you want to download your books
to. This is important, because the downloaded books will be DRMd to that
particular device. The serial number (which is required to remove DRM) will be
printed (and saved to the log if specified) when the books are downloaded.

## Tips

If the script doesn't log in successfully, wait a moment and try again. Sometimes, 
the Amazon website doesn't load correctly, and the script can't find the 'sign in' 
button to click. It will then fail with a 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException' 
error.

I recommend using the LOGFILE variable to save your output, it will note the ASINs of 
any books it fails to download, so you can fill those in with a second pass or else
manually download them.
